# Design system
Link: https://kmpstrk.github.io/design-system

This project is a design system built from scratch using React and TypeScript. The goal of the project is to create a reusable and scalable component library that adheres to consistent design principles, making it easier to build user interfaces across multiple projects.

## Project Objectives:
* Build Reusable UI Components
* Leverage TypeScript to enforce type safety and improve code reliability
* Apply component-level styling using CSS, with focus on state-based styles (hover, focus, disabled), and flexible layout options
* Design System Documentation with Storybook
* Use Storybook to simulate component states (hover, focus, active)
* Create a system that can be easily extended by adding new components or themes.

## Technologies Used:
* React + Vite: Component-based architecture for building UI.
* Typescript + SWC: Strongly typed JavaScript for better tooling and code safety.
* Storybook: Visual documentation and testing environment for showcasing component variations and interaction.
* CSS: Custom styling for each component with responsiveness and theme support.

## Key Features:
* Custom Components: Includes a range of components like buttons, text inputs, radio buttons, toggles, and more, all styled consistently.
* Stateful and Interactive Components: Components handle different states such as hover, active, and disabled, allowing for dynamic interaction in the UI.
* Storybook Integration: Storybook serves as the central hub for visualizing, testing, and documenting components.
